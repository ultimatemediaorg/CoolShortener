# CoolShortener

A link shortener for Jekyll.

## Setup

1. Fork this repo.
2. Edit the `repo` variable in `_config.yml`. This should be the repository owner and name in this format: `owner/name`.
3. Edit the `redirect_to` variable in `_config.yml`. This will be the link to your website.

## Making short links

To create a short link, create an issue with the long link as the title. You will receive a comment with the short link ID.
